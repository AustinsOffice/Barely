Barely
======

A basic Wordpress theme that includes the bones for creating a Wordpress theme. The stuff includes Wordpress template files, easy-to-modify SCSS, Gridly (custom responsive, fluid grid), and Grunt stuff.

This theme is by no means meant to be a complete, ready-to-go solution. If you're not a developer don't bother unless you just absolutely love what you see!

Barely
======

A basic Wordpress theme that includes the bones for creating a Wordpress theme. The stuff includes Wordpress template files, easy-to-modify SCSS, and Gridly (custom responsive, fluid grid).

This theme is by no means meant to be a complete, ready-to-go solution. I wouldn't recommend this theme unless you're a developer or you just absolutely love what you see!
